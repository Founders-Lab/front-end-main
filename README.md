What is FoundersLab?

Founders Lab is a Web 3.0 platform for innovators, visionaries, change makers and independent experts to work on building products on their own terms in a stress-free, scalable, accountable and transparent way. It's breaking old models of "consulting", "free lance", "dev shops" where parties are bound by contracts, legal terms and instead putting them on a blockchain so there is complete transparency, accountability and scalability.  
The Founder's Coin or $FNDR token is a crypto currency that will serve as a medium of payment within FoundersLab.

The platform  
Founders Lab is a decentralised Web3.0 platform based on the Polygon blockchain that enables founders to start, manage Web3.0 based projects and work with brilliant Web3 Talents around the world collaboratively. Unlike a freelancer platform or a hiring platform, in Founders Lab "people" or their "time" isn't the product that's selling here. On the contrary it is the "work done" that's being valued and paid for.

FoundersLab Architecture

Apps built with the Polygon blockchain give users control over their digital identities, assets, and data.
And since storing data in blockchain is expensive and due to limited technical feasibility, a hybrid architecture is chosen to build Founders Lab.
Founders with Hiro Wallet account can initiate a smart contract with App. The App relies on Polygon Ecosystem to create, validate, deploy and execute smart contracts, besides a serverless framework, a relational data store and external products.
